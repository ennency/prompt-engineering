# Prompt Library

A small client-side app that lets you save and delete prompts using `localStorage`.

Usage

1. Open [index.html](index.html) in a browser.
2. Enter a title and prompt content, then click "Save Prompt".
3. Prompts are stored in your browser's `localStorage` and displayed on the page.
4. Use "Delete" on a prompt card to remove it, or "Delete All" to clear everything.
